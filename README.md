# MachineLearningforPhysicalApplications

IMPORTANT: To run codes as-is, please download the "data/" directory at: . Put the "data/" folder and its contents in the directory where the other files are stored (inside "MachineLearningforPhysicalApplications-master" folder if you download from Github).

This is a public repository that contains scripts in Matlab, Python, and Python with Tensorflow. The scripts run machine learning classification or regression schemes. Homework related to these tasks can be found under ECE 285 (http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE285/) by Dr. Gerstoft. For research applications, see references below.
